## Data used on this project


 Api

>(http://dataatwork.org/data/)

 Database

>(http://www.potacho.com/files/ironhack/raw_data_project_m1.db)
 
 Country codes

>(https://www.iban.com/country-codes)


## Development


This pipeline is based on Potacho's project template, the main problem I encountered
during this project was making the API caller work properly and efficiently
(which took me several, several, several days).
Because of this delay I ran out out time to make more than challenge one
and still having the first challenge done, its needs work to be done on it.




## TO DO


This project needs :

- Lost of refactoring;
 >Some of its code can be redundant, and the functions can be done sorter

- A filter;
>I made the database for challenge one but it needs a filter added, so we 
>can chose the country we ent the data from.

- A reporting method;
>I just made the date to be sent to a local folder, but I would like to add 
>a bar chart and a method for the data to be sent by email.

- I think I should add organise way more than I did on this project, this features
to develop were not done just because I ran out time so...
